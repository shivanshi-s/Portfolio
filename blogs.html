        <h2>Around the world in 80 Seconds</h2>
    <p>Today was a nice, cloudy day. Nice enough for me to pick out a book and sit in the balcony with a coffee in hand, away from my laptop, which I love, very much. I believe every programmer should have the habit of reading, even if it is just one page a day. So here are some books (coding and non-coding) that I enjoyed!......... <a href="https://medium.com/@whatshivanshi/around-the-world-in-80-seconds-c65c44e01440">Read More</a></p>

    <p>A very crucial step next to picking a language, is to choose the right resources to learn it. With the vast connectivity of the world out there, it is really easy to get lost between one course or the other.
